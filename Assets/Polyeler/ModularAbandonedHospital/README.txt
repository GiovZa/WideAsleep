-((Modular Abandoned Hospital))-

Thank you for purchasing the Modular Abandoned Hospital asset! We hope this package enhances your 
projects and helps you create immersive, detailed environments with ease.

•Contents
Modular Assets: Walls, floors, ceilings, doors, windows, and props for creating custom abandoned hospital environments.
Prefabs: Pre-built modular room setups for quick level design.
Textures: High-quality, PBR textures for realistic visuals (diffuse, normal, specular, etc.).
Materials: Pre-configured materials for use in Unity's Standard Shader.
Scenes: Example scenes to showcase the possible usage of the assets.

•Requirements
Unity Version: 2022.3.9f1 or higher
Render Pipeline: Works with both Built-in and URP (Universal Render Pipeline). 
Adjust materials for compatibility if switching between pipelines.

•Installation
Import the package into your Unity project by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and choose the downloaded .unitypackage file.
Ensure all dependencies are correctly imported. If prompted, update materials to match your project's render pipeline.

•Usage
Modular Components
The assets in this package are designed to be modular, meaning you can mix and match walls, floors, and props to create a variety of unique layouts.
Each asset is snapped to a grid, making it easy to align objects within your scene.
Example Usage: Drag and drop prefabs into your scene, or create custom rooms by manually placing individual components.

•Prefabs
Pre-configured rooms and areas are available under the Prefabs folder for quick level design.
These can be used as-is or modified to fit your specific needs.

•Customization
You can modify the materials, textures, and models to suit your projectÅfs needs.
If you're using URP or HDRP, ensure you update the materials to match the correct shaders for your pipeline.

•Performance Tips
To maintain optimal performance, we recommend using level of detail (LOD) groups for larger or more complex scenes.
Make sure to optimize lighting and shadow settings, especially for mobile or lower-end hardware.

•Troubleshooting
Missing Textures/Materials: If you encounter missing textures or materials, ensure that your projectÅfs render pipeline matches the materialsÅf configurations.
Performance Issues: If you notice performance drops, check the complexity of your scenes, and consider using UnityÅfs built-in optimization tools such as Occlusion Culling and Batching.
